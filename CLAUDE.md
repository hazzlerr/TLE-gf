# TLE-gf

TLE-gf is a fork of [TLE](https://github.com/cheran-senthil/TLE), a Discord bot for competitive programming communities. It integrates with Codeforces for problem recommendations, rating tracking, duels, and training. The bot uses discord.py v2, SQLite for persistence, and is structured around cogs (modular command groups).

## What was built

### DB Migration System (`tle/util/db/upgrades.py`, `tle/util/db/user_db_upgrades.py`)

TLE-gf had no schema migration system — every table used `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, so adding columns to existing DBs was silently ignored. We added an `UpgradeRegistry` that tracks a `db_version` table and runs versioned upgrade functions (1.0.0 through 1.4.0). Fresh DBs get stamped at the latest version; existing DBs run pending upgrades.

### Multi-Emoji Starboard (`tle/cogs/starboard.py`)

The original starboard was hardcoded to a single star emoji. We rewrote it to support multiple emojis per guild, each with its own threshold, color, and channel. The schema moved from `starboard`/`starboard_message` to `starboard_config_v1`, `starboard_emoji_v1`, `starboard_message_v1`.

### Starboard Leaderboards

Added `;starboard leaderboard <emoji>` (by message count) and `;starboard star-leaderboard <emoji>` (by total stars). Gated behind a `starboard_leaderboard` guild config flag enabled via `;meta config enable starboard_leaderboard`.

### Background Backfill

A one-time background task runs on startup to populate `author_id` and `star_count` for existing starboard messages by fetching them from Discord. Uses `author_id IS NULL` as a checkpoint — already-processed messages are skipped on restart. Unfetchable messages get an `__UNKNOWN__` sentinel to prevent infinite retries.

### Guild Config System

Key-value config per guild (`guild_config` table). Used for feature gating (e.g., `starboard_leaderboard`). Managed via `;meta config`.

## Key files

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `tle/util/db/upgrades.py` | Generic `UpgradeRegistry` class |
| `tle/util/db/user_db_upgrades.py` | Upgrade functions 1.0.0 - 1.4.0 |
| `tle/util/db/user_db_conn.py` | All DB methods (starboard, guild config, leaderboards) |
| `tle/cogs/starboard.py` | Starboard cog (reactions, commands, backfill) |
| `tle/cogs/meta.py` | Meta cog (guild config commands) |
| `tle/constants.py` | `_DEFAULT_STAR_COLOR`, `_DEFAULT_STAR`, `TLE_ADMIN` |
| `tests/conftest.py` | Test setup — stubs discord.py, aiohttp, etc. via `sys.modules` |

## Architecture notes

- **SQLite with namedtuple rows**: `user_db_conn.py` uses `namedtuple_factory` as the row factory, so query results use attribute access (`row.guild_id`). Non-identifier column names (like `SELECT 1`) get aliased to `col_0`.
- **Discord IDs are TEXT in SQLite**: Discord IDs are Python ints but stored as TEXT. All DB methods cast with `str()`.
- **Per-guild asyncio.Lock**: Starboard uses one lock per guild to prevent duplicate starboard posts from concurrent reactions.
- **`INSERT OR IGNORE` for messages, `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` for emojis**: Messages should never be overwritten; emoji config upserts must preserve `channel_id`.
- **Backfill checkpointing**: `author_id IS NULL` = pending. `__UNKNOWN__` = unfetchable (excluded from leaderboards). Already-set `author_id` = done.

## Running tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests stub out discord.py, aiohttp, and other heavy deps in `conftest.py` so they run against in-memory SQLite without the full bot environment.

## Commits convention

Use imperative mood, short first line. `Co-Authored-By` trailer when AI-assisted. Always stage files and commit without being asked. Do not use `$()` command substitution in commit messages — use a plain string with `-m`.
