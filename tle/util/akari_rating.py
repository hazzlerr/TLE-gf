"""Codeforces-style multiplayer rating for Daily Akari.

Each Akari day (one ``puzzle_number`` per day) is treated as a single Codeforces
contest: every player who submitted that day is ranked against the others, and
ratings move toward each player's expected-versus-actual rank using the exact
Codeforces rating formula (logistic win-probabilities, expected-rank "seed",
geometric-mean target rank, binary-searched needed rating, and the two CF
anti-inflation corrections).  The final per-contest change is then scaled by a
small ``damping`` factor so the rating is *way less volatile* than real CF —
appropriate because Akari is played daily, so a year of play is hundreds of
"contests" and the undamped formula would swing wildly.

This module is pure: no database, no discord, no wall-clock.  Given the same
result rows it always returns the same ratings, regardless of row order, which
keeps it trivially unit-testable and lets callers replay the full history on
every change.

Players start at :data:`tle.constants.AKARI_START_RATING` (1200).  Ratings are
kept as ``float`` throughout the replay (and stored as ``REAL``); callers round
only for display.  At a quarter-strength damping, rounding every daily delta to
an integer would floor most of them to zero and ratings would never move.

Inactive players also decay back toward the default rating, with the pull
growing the longer they stay away (see :func:`compute_ratings`).
