"""Codeforces-style multiplayer rating for Daily Akari.

Each Akari day (one ``puzzle_number`` per day) is treated as a single Codeforces
contest: every player who submitted that day is ranked against the others, and
ratings move toward each player's expected-versus-actual rank using the exact
Codeforces rating formula (logistic win-probabilities, expected-rank "seed",
geometric-mean target rank, binary-searched needed rating, and the two CF
anti-inflation corrections).  The final per-contest change is then scaled by a
small ``damping`` factor so the rating is *way less volatile* than real CF —
appropriate because Akari is played daily, so a year of play is hundreds of
"contests" and the undamped formula would swing wildly.

This module is pure: no database, no discord, no wall-clock.  Given the same
result rows it always returns the same ratings, regardless of row order, which
keeps it trivially unit-testable and lets callers replay the full history on
every change.

Players start at :data:`tle.constants.AKARI_START_RATING` (1200).  Ratings are
kept as ``float`` throughout the replay (and stored as ``REAL``); callers round
only for display.  At a quarter-strength damping, rounding every daily delta to
an integer would floor most of them to zero and ratings would never move.

Inactive players above the default rating decay back toward it, with the pull
growing the longer they stay away (see :func:`compute_ratings`).  The points
they lose are pooled and redistributed equally to the day's active players —
the rating ladder is zero-sum within each puzzle day, so coasters' rating
funds the regulars instead of vanishing.  Sub-default absentees freeze rather
than drift up: the engine refuses to create rating ex nihilo.

    the DB's first-submission-per-(user, puzzle) rows
    (``get_minigame_results_for_guild``) so a player's locked-in first result is
    what counts — resubmitting a better time can't farm rating.

    Days are processed by ascending ``puzzle_number``.  Rows whose puzzle number
    is non-positive or greater than ``max_puzzle`` (when given) are dropped as bad
    data.  A newly seen player is seeded at ``start_rating`` (default 1200).  Days
    with fewer than two players are not a contest and change nothing (but still
    seed any newcomer).

    **Inactivity decay:** for every day present in the data, each previously seen
    player who did *not* submit that day has their consecutive-skip streak bumped
    and their above-default rating pulled toward ``start_rating`` by
    :func:`_decay_rate` of the remaining gap — stronger the longer they stay
    away.  Sub-default absentees freeze (no drift up) so the engine never
    creates rating ex nihilo.  The lost points are pooled and split equally
    among the day's active players, conserving total guild rating across the
    day.  Playing resets the streak.
    The "days" counted are days the guild was active (puzzles in the data), so
    decay advances as others keep playing, not by wall-clock; it is therefore a
    pure, deterministic function of the result rows.

    **History capture:** pass an empty dict as ``histories`` to receive
    ``{user_id: [HistoryPoint, ...]}`` covering every day each user actually
    played.  Decay days don't produce their own entries — their effect surfaces
    in the next played day's rating, so the line a caller plots through the
    points already accounts for any intervening inactivity.

    Pass ``include_decay_in_history=True`` to additionally emit one point per
    absent puzzle day for every user already seen on a prior day, with
    ``is_decay=True``, ``delta`` set to that day's decay (zero during grace)
    and ``rating`` set to the post-decay value.  A caller can then plot a
    fully day-resolved trajectory — playing days are still distinguishable
    via ``is_decay=False``.

    ``current_puzzle_number`` (optional): the puzzle that is "in progress" on
    the server's wall clock — i.e. ``expected_puzzle_number(date.today())``.
    Absence decay (and its history points / skip-streak bumps) is gated on
    ``puzzle_number < current_puzzle_number``, so the still-open day does not
    punish anyone who hasn't posted yet.  Contest math among players who *did*
    post on the current day still runs.  Leave as ``None`` (default) to treat
    every puzzle day in the data as concluded — useful in tests where there
