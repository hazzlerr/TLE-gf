"""Thin async client for The Odds API (the-odds-api.com).

The betting cog needs three things from the API: a list of soccer
competitions in season, upcoming matches with 1X2 (h2h) odds, and final
scores to auto-settle on. Network I/O lives here; the parsing of raw payloads
is split into pure functions so it can be unit-tested without a key or a
socket.

Free tier is ~500 requests/month, so callers should fetch sparingly and
cache — one request per sport key per refresh.
