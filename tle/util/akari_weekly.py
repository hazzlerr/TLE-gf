"""Weekly Daily Akari scoring and rating replay.

One Monday-Sunday week is one rating contest.  Each puzzle contributes a
difficulty-weighted score in [0, 1-ish], and the seven scores are summed before
the existing Codeforces-style multiplayer rating round is applied.

The tuning constants are intentionally gathered at the top of this module so
the preview model can be adjusted without touching the replay machinery.
