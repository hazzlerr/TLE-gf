"""Thin async client for football-data.org — used only to read World Cup
results, so settlement is free and frequent (the free tier is rate-limited,
~10 req/min, not credit-limited). The Odds API stays the source of odds.

football-data.org has its own match ids and (sometimes) team spellings, so a
result is linked back to an Odds-API event by normalized team names + kickoff
date. Network I/O is isolated here; parsing/matching are pure for testing.
